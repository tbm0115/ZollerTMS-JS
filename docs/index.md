# Zoller TMS Client
ZollerTMS-JS is a clientside library that simplifies querying of the Zoller Tool Management System Web Service.

# Installation
Clone and copy the `Zoller Interface.js` and `Zoller Interface_Server.cs/vb` into your project.

`Zoller Interface.js` is the clientside library.

`Zoller Interface_Server.cs/vb` is the serverside proxy to make requests to the Zoller TMS Web Service.

# Getting Started
Implement the server-side proxy (`Zoller Interface_Server.cs/vb`) into your web app and ensure it is properly routed.

Update the `Zoller Interface.js` file to reference the correct proxy endpoint (`ZollerGlobal.WebServiceBaseURL`)
